# Machine-Learning-with-NumPy
Collection of notebooks containing NumPy implementations of the most common supervised machine learning techniques. Along with a simple demonstration of their use and the benefits of various features and optimisations that I included whenever I saw an opportunity. 

Notebooks:
1. Perceptron
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Naive Bayes
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Support Vector Machine
7. Gaussian Regression
8. Decision Tree - bagged & boosted
9. Neural Network

I produced these notebooks whilst simultaneously learning my first programming language and studying Supervised Machine Learning theory for the first time, as a way of improving my coding skills and furthering my understanding of the various supervised learning techniques.
